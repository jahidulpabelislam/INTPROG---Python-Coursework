#Patchwork Sampler

During 1st year of my degree (2014) using Python on IEP environment I had to create a visual display of 2 different patchworks.

It takes in the number of rows and columns it should be and the colour sequence via user input then patchwork one is displayed at the 1st column and two bottom rows and the rest is patchwork two.

I have used graphics.py as the graphics module.

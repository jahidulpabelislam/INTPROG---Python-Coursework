# Patchwork Sampler

During the 1st year of my degree (2014), I was tasked to create a visual display of 2 different patchworks using Python on IEP environment.

There are two preset patchwork styles, valid set of 6 colour choices & 3 valid sets of the number of rows/columns. Patchwork one is displayed at the 1st column and two bottom rows and the rest is patchwork two. And the final display of the patchworks is defined from user inputs.

The colour of each patchwork item is chosen from the order of users colour choice inputs (for example the user inputted red, green, blue & yellow therefore the colours of patchworks is in this order and from left to right the colour of each is set using this order).

The display is interactive is such that when a patchwork is clicked the colour of it changes to the next colour from the colour inputted order.

I used graphics.py as the graphics module.
